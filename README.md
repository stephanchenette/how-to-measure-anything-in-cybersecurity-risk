"How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk" by Douglas W. Hubbard and Richard Seiersen presents several key ideas and concepts. Here are some of the core ideas:

* Calibration of Estimates - Improve the accuracy of subjective estimates by calibrating them.
* Monte Carlo Simulations - Use Monte Carlo simulations to quantify uncertainties and model risks.
* Risk Matrix Analysis - Translate qualitative risk assessments into quantitative measures using a risk matrix.
* Bayesian Inference - Apply Bayesian methods to update the probability of a cybersecurity event as new evidence is obtained.
